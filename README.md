This program selects random pairs of names to be ordered alphabetically.

Begin a round with one of the following commands:

D - Default; A valid pair will contain 2 unique names whose first letters are within 3 places of each other

S - Similar; A valid pair will contain 2 names beginning with the same letter, whose second letters are within 3 places of each other

L - Letters; A valid pair will contain 2 letters

U - Unrestricted; A valid pair will contain 2 unique names

N - Nonfiction; A valid pair will contain 2 3-digit numbers which may be followed by decimal digits, and must be followed by names whose first letters are within 3 places of each other

Pressing Enter, Space, or the Start/Restart button will begin a round of the most recently selected type.

Enter a 3-digit number of seconds into the "Allotted seconds" field if you wish for a round to last a particular amount of time. Leaving the field blank will result in a 30-second round.
